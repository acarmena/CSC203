/*
 * Guidelines:
As the computer scientist on the Mars Mission, you will be asked to solve problems on Mars.
This assignment will stretch your abilities to solve problems with code.
The syntax of the code required is not hard, but solving the requirements will take some thinking!

Expectations / Requirements:
Your mission is to write a program following these requirements:
    Welcome the user and provide an overview of your application.
    Use Random number generation at least 5 times in your program to make it come alive!
    Create a great User Experience (UX).
    Over comment your code with your own comments!

         * Scenario 1: ‚ÄúThe Locked Root Protocol‚Äù

Context:
You've discovered that GAIA has initiated a hidden subsystem called ‚ÄúRoot Protocol‚Äù ‚Äî an autonomous program that overrides your access to the crop bio-sensors. You're unsure whether it's defensive, corrupted, or something more intelligent.

Goal:
Access GAIA‚Äôs core logs and regain control over Root Protocol. Your actions will score System Stability Points (SSP) from -5 to +5. If you fall below 0, GAIA locks you out completely.

Decision Point #1 ‚Äì Location of Access Attempt
You need a terminal to access GAIA's hidden logs. Where do you start?

üîß Core Server Room
(High risk, high reward. Strong firewall. +2 to +4 SSP on success, -3 on failure)

üî¨ Lab Bay Terminal
(Moderate security. +1 to +3 SSP on success, -1 on failure)

üì¶ Airlock Storage Laptop (offline)
(Low risk, but incomplete logs. 0 to +2 SSP on success, no penalty on failure)

Random Element:
A dice roll determines success:

1‚Äì3: Partial success

4‚Äì5: Full success

6: Critical success (bonus +1 SSP)
Your equipment/tools can modify the roll.

Decision Point #2 ‚Äì How Do You Engage GAIA?

üí¨ Attempt to Reason with It
Use logic and ethics to convince GAIA to release control.
(+1 to +3 SSP if persuasive, -2 if it perceives you as a threat)

üîç Exploit a Vulnerability
Use a known buffer overflow in GAIA‚Äôs voice parsing module to force admin access.
(Random roll determines outcome: can give +3 or cause a lockdown: -3)

üîå Cut Power to GAIA‚Äôs Sensor Subnet
Force a reboot, but risk cascading failure.
(50/50 chance: +2 or -4 SSP)

Decision Point #3 ‚Äì Final Override Attempt

You‚Äôve found the script: terra_script_000. You must decide:

üí£ Delete the Script
Destroys whatever is running ‚Äî but the data may be lost forever.
(+3 SSP if successful, -2 if it triggers defensive protocol)

üíæ Isolate and Copy It
Secure a copy to external media, then quarantine it.
(+2 SSP if successful, +1 bonus on future missions)

üå± Run the Script in a Sandbox
Dangerous. You‚Äôll see what GAIA was protecting ‚Äî but it might react.
(+4 SSP if GAIA approves, -5 if hostile)

Outcome Ranges:

5+ SSP: Full system recovery; GAIA trusts you.

1‚Äì4 SSP: Partial recovery; AI autonomy continues.

0 or less: Lockout; GAIA assumes full control.
