/*
 * Guidelines:
As the computer scientist on the Mars Mission, you will be asked to solve problems on Mars.
This assignment will stretch your abilities to solve problems with code.
The syntax of the code required is not hard, but solving the requirements will take some thinking!

Expectations / Requirements:
Your mission is to write a program following these requirements:
    Welcome the user and provide an overview of your application.
    Use Random number generation at least 5 times in your program to make it come alive!
    Create a great User Experience (UX).
    Over comment your code with your own comments!
