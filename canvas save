Class
A class in java is a template, or blueprint, for objects. Everything in Java is associated with a class of some sort.
Subclass
A subclass in java is a miniature or child class that extends a parent class.
Access
There are three different types of access modifiers:

Default; this access modifier is when the programmer does not specify which type of access a variable has within a class. The default is when the variable can only be accessed by classes in the same package.
Private; this access modifier is when the variable is class specific. The variable is only accessible within that declared class.
Public; this access modifier gives other classes access to this variable no matter where it is.
Scope

Scope is how much variables can access inside the region where they are created.

As a computer scientist, write a scenario of when and how access modifiers could be used.


A scenario where access modifiers could be used is...
